                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>My name is Aary, and I made a website to document my trash for the week, every week. I upload images, histories, and descriptions of my trash every Sunday night for all the world to see. Why? It has to do with the history of trash.</p>
                <p>We grow up in a time of mass-consumerism, and with fast food and fast fashion, we create a lot more waste than societies likely made in the past. We buy new stuff without thinking about its future with us, if it will fit into our lives long-term. We buy it with a narrow outlook. In fact, we do this in a digital sense, as well. We care so much about getting likes on TikTok or Instagram that, not only do we constantly try to buy the newest, coolest, most fashionable stuff, but we clog our digital lives and portfolios with things we do not truly care about, all in the act of seeking fast fame. <a target="_blank" href="https://fallowmedia.com/2016/feb/waste/">Brian Thill</a> discusses this issue in his book about waste when he talks about “digital detritus”. This concept relates to all the junk that lies in our screens, the stuff we have accumulated for years. While it is easier to throw out digital waste compared to physical waste due to the recycling bin that all computers and programs come with in some form, it is also incredibly easy to store useless links and information that we will likely never get around to looking into. It is also easy to post videos that clog our profiles and the feeds of our followers, as I spoke about earlier in regards to fast fame. In this modern time, we are creating more waste than ever before.</p>
                <p>Trash was not necessarily always a part of human life. As Theresa Machemer writes in her article about Pompeii, “one local’s trash could have easily become another’s building materials”. Ancient Romans seem to have recycled the majority of their material, living up to the notion of one man’s trash being another’s treasure. However, in our society today, we do not quite understand that things were different in the past. We mindlessly send away all of our waste, thinking it is lost forever and never worrying about it again. However, it is never lost. The Ancient Romans’ recycled material exists to this day, and so does the waste we cast out of our homes. Our trash does not truly go away, just to another place, and it often still affects people long after it is off our mind.</p>
                <p>Our trash does not truly go away. CEO Boyan Slat of The Ocean Cleanup ensures we do not forget this through his nonprofit organization that attempts to conduct what they call “the largest cleanup in history”. According to this group, “trillions of pieces of plastic pollute our oceans today, and the problem is worsening”. We may believe that our waste disappears when we take it to the street corner, but in reality it pollutes this Earth, destroys ecosystems, and kills animals. There is no better way to say it than that. That brings us back to the original question: why do I document my trash?</p>
                <p>It would be unreasonable to call this site an activist project. While it does allude to and support environmental causes, documenting one’s trash is not truly activism when done in a vacuum. In reality, this project is meant to be more of a personal art project. <a target="_blank" href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash">Sarah Newman</a> once explained how she would have her students look at pictures of people lying on a week’s worth of their trash, except she would remove the people and then ask her students to describe what the person looked like just based on their trash. The students would often find a lot of success in this task, which suggests that our trash is a part of us, expressing parts of our personalities simply through its existence. I am just a college student, struggling with my own self image, attempting to find myself and using my own trash as a means to such an end. Along with this, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html">Vik Muniz</a> discusses how he used his art projects related to trash to escape the Sisyphean redundancy that comes with our contemporary, consumerist culture. I have already discussed my disdain for our mass-consumerist tendencies in modern, Western culture, but I have not quite delved into the idea of escaping redundancy. This concept differs from that of escaping monotony. Monotony can be beautiful in its own way, because it brings with it a sense of peace. However, the redundancy we see with taking out trash is harmful, taking away the full potential of an object. Our current view on waste is, in essence, wasteful. To escape the constant rolling of this rock up this mountain, we need to first fight to engage in a new discussion with ourselves about the concept of our own, personal trash.</p>
                <p>All of this is why I started documenting my trash. I started thinking about what I am buying, what I am removing, and what my history with it was. Was it worth it? Did I buy this product years ago and allow it to be a part of my life until it ran out of use? Or did I buy it a week ago before getting tired of it, not understanding the life it could have had if I had acknowledged the depth of importance there is in making a new purchase. By analyzing such a Sisyphean task more mindfully, I can hopefully help contribute to a better world by attempting to change my own view on trash.</p>
