        <h2 id="preface">Preface: What Is This?</h2>
            <p>My name is Aary, and I made a website to document my trash for the week, every week. I upload images, 
            histories, and descriptions of my trash every Sunday night for all the world to see. Why? It has to 
            do with the history of trash.</p>
            <p>Trash was not necessarily always a part of human life. We grow up in 
            a time of mass-consumerism, where getting a lot of likes on TikTok or Instagram often requires having the newest, 
            coolest, most fashionable stuff. With fast fashion, fast food, and fast fame, we create a lot more waste than societies 
            likely made in the past. We buy new stuff without thinking about its future with us, if it will fit into 
            our lives long-term. We buy it with a narrow outlook.</p>
            <p>As such, I started documenting my trash. I started 
            thinking about what I am buying, what I am removing, and what was my history with it. Was it worth it? Did I 
            buy this product years ago and allow it to be a part of my life until it ran out of use? Or did I buy it a week ago 
            before getting tired of it, not understanding the life it could have had if I had acknowledged the depth of importance 
            there is in making a new purchase.</p>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview: This Week!</h2>
            <p>This week on Aary’s Trash, I have much more interesting and varied stuff than normal! I decided that with 
                the start of the new semester of college, it was time to clear out my room and, thus, clear my mind. After 
                getting myself situated with my new classes, I started digging into the deepest crevices of my room to 
                finally get rid of the parasitic products that have latched onto my hoarding tendencies for far too long.</p>
            <h3><em>Overstayed</em></h3>
                <p>First up are the items that I held onto for too long. The first is a green 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_floss#Floss_pick">floss pick</a>, 
                    which one could guess is used to floss your teeth. I had a whole bag of these and slowly whittled them down, 
                    until I was down to the last few. However, I bought a new bag of a different brand that I was recommended 
                    by my girlfriend, and it was much nicer quality in my opinion, so I never felt the need to finish 
                    the last few of this brand of floss picks. I also had two little pieces of plastics that are made to 
                    aesthetically cover screws in furniture. Specifically, these ones were made for my old desk chair before 
                    I replaced it recently. The chair lasted me for years, but the leather was peeling off onto the ground 
                    around me and these <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_cap">screw caps</a> 
                    would fall out constantly which frustrated me, until I chose to just leave them out and forget about them 
                    in a drawer. Finally in this category, I have a 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box">box</a> that holds an outlet extender. It has 
                    been sitting on a chair in my room for weeks because I did not get around to plugging in the product, 
                    and so I never got rid of the trash associated with it. All of this stuff has been cramming my room and 
                    my mind for far too long, and it’s time for it to make its exit.</p>
            <h3><em>Electronics</em></h3>
                <p>Next up are my broken electronics. One is a red and black 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse">gaming mouse</a> with a variety of 
                    different buttons. I loved using this mouse, and I spent many years playing Minecraft using it, but 
                    eventually no computers would notice its existence regardless of where I plugged it in, and it was 
                    time to be replaced. There is also a 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard">computer keyboard</a> that 
                    I used to make video edits and type into the YouTube search bar to find new videos. It came with a mouse, 
                    but the battery within that mouse exploded which made the product unusable, and thus caused the keyboard 
                    to be unusable in tandem. Finally, my old 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam">webcam</a>. I was fond of making silly 
                    videos for YouTube, school assignments, and just for/with my friends. I would use this webcam in such a 
                    way, but it started glitching and the video was no longer discernible. I will miss all of these products, 
                    but they had full lives and they have since been replaced. I hung onto them out of a belief I could fix 
                    or salvage them one day, but it’s time to go.</p>
            <h3><em>Sentimental</em></h3>
                <p>Finally, I found items that were sentimental to me in some way that I no longer want to hold onto. First 
                    up are two books that were a part of the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_39_Clues">39 Clues</a> series. I saw 
                    that Rick Riordan was an author attached to the project which excited me as a young Percy Jackson fan, 
                    so I bought these two. The idea of collectible items in the books and the air of mystery around the entire 
                    story were enrapturing, but I never managed to get my hands on any of the other books in the series, and 
                    I do not have as much of an interest in doing so any longer. Next are a pair of 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe">shoes</a> I owned for a while. I got them 
                    cheap and loved them because of their bright blue and green trims, the only interesting pieces in an otherwise 
                    drab wardrobe. They are too old for me to wear now, and my wardrobe has gotten an upgrade, but I was 
                    scared of letting them go and potentially going back to a world of bad style. Finally, a 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel's Avengers</a> 
                    poster that I was given when I went to see Endgame on release day. I went there at 9am 
                    with my parents (who do not understand Marvel at all) and walked out with this memorabilia. It 
                    fit on a little, unobtrusive place on my wall so I did not think to remove it, but I no longer 
                    have much interest in Marvel and the poster was beginning to fall off, so it seemed like the right 
                    time to get rid of it. These items are the scariest to get rid of, because they all had so much impact 
                    on my past, but refusing to change and grow is toxic to oneself and it’s time to let these go.</p>

        <h2 id="profile">Profile: Item of the Week!</h2>
            <p>My item of the week for this week is my broken gaming mouse. As I grew up, I gained more interest in 
                video games and computers in general, and I started purchasing more electronics including a laptop 
                and laptop accessories. This gaming mouse was cheap and had good reviews, so I bought it with my 
                computer and quickly made use of it to play mostly Minecraft, and to learn new software like Davinci 
                Resolve, and watch content online. I was obsessed with technology and this mouse came with me on my 
                education journey. I remember one day where I was clicking the mouse like crazy because I was so 
                locked into the work I was doing, and my dad got frustrated with me for being so loud and clicking 
                the mouse so much. I was working too fast! One day, the mouse stopped moving on the screen when I 
                would move it in real life, and the laptop stopped making the sound it made when something was 
                plugged into its USB slots. The wire seemed to have broken. I sadly bought a replacement that was 
                almost the exact same as this one, and it has also lasted me for years, until today in fact. It’s 
                sad to part with the mouse, but it’s time to move forward.</p>
            <p>Since then, I learned that this mouse has been discontinued by its company. However, I have also 
                learned that many different laptop accessory companies make a mouse that is almost exactly the 
                same as this one. From my perspective, I think the mice companies have developed the best gaming 
                mouse they need for cheap usage. Each company diverges for more expensive mice as they attempt 
                to push the boundaries of the technology, but it seems this one has become a baseline because of 
                how cheap yet effective it is.</p>

        <h2 id="coda">Coda: See You Next Time!</h2>
            <p>It was a very productive week! I had a great time going through my old stuff and starting to clear up 
                what was truly important to me and what needed to go, but I hope all of my trash continues to contribute 
                to society in some way after it leaves my room. Some of it will be donated, some of it will be recycled 
                into something new, and hopefully only a little of it will help fill up a landfill. Thank you for 
                reading, let me know if you have any thoughts or any stories you would like to share of your own trash 
                for the week, and I hope you’ll join me again next week!</p>
