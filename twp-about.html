                <p>Aary Ratman</p>
                <p>Aary is a Junior majoring in Information Technology and Informatics and minoring in Sociology. He is currently applying to internships in a variety of technological fields, including data management, web and game development, Cisco, and artificial intelligence to prepare himself for the workforce when he graduates. He has been learning Norwegian for almost 2 years in hopes of having the opportunity to move to Norway in the future. He has been practicing his creative writing, and while he is proud of the academic papers he has developed in college so far, he wants to put effort into developing more descriptive and intriguing works. He is also excited to put his creativity and programming skills to the test by developing websites and apps, including his Trash of the Week website, his organizational apps, and his cat-based mobile game. In his free time, Aary is a fan of reading books, watching television, and playing video games, and he specifically enjoys analyzing all of these pieces of media to the fullest extent possible.</p>
